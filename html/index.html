                        <h4 id="list-item-6">Intro</h4>
                        <p>Background: Our team was tasked with finding a problem and designing a solution for it. We brainstormed, created a survey, and conducted user interviews to dial in our hypothesis. <br>The Problem: Growing food is overwhelming for many because they don’t have the right support for the journey. They struggle to find the right information and to keep track of all of their plants’ needs.<br>The Solution: We designed GreenThumb to achieve more confidence and success for home gardeners. We strove to deliver information in a more succinct way so that our customers spend less time guessing about and more time enjoying their gardens.
                        <h4 id="list-item-1">Empathize</h4>
                        <p>We conducted research in two ways. First, we set up a survey to ask some basic questions and to find out a bit more about our potential user population. Next, we created and conducted user interviews on classmates and family members. We focused only on interviewing those that had experiences with growing food. 
                            We came up with the content of this research by ideating on topics that would give us the best look into a user’s needs. For the survey, we focused on anonymously gathering the user’s background information: their age, gender, location, and their general journey with gardening. We also asked about their confidence in using technology. For the interviews, we got more specific. We aimed to find out what motivates our users and what holds them back. We asked them about how they gathered information or planned prior to planting. We played off of some interview questions that are known to be beneficial to get the perfect mix. <br>
                            
                            <strong>Results</strong><br>
                            We found these as the main motivations for people growing their own food: <br>
                            75% answered they grow their own food as a hobby <br>
                            50% for health reasons <br>
                            45.8% environmental concerns	<br>
                            We found people felt fairly comfortable using technology: <br>
                            50% feel very comfortable with technology <br>
                            33.3% feel fairly comfortable with technology <br>

                            There is a lot of information that pops up when you Google search for gardening information. Many times these results are conflicting or do not give complete care instructions on the same page. We created SWOT diagrams with competitor gardening apps revealing features we liked, including weather and location tracking, simple illustrations and icons, as well as weaknesses such as poor onboarding, incomplete user flows, and ads overtaking the information.
                            </p>
                        <h4 id="list-item-2">Define</h4>
                        <p>Our key findings of the interviews were:
                            People seek many types of information about their plants when planning their gardens & want it all in one, easily accessible location <br>
                            Their gardens failed due to lack of schedule or reminders <br>
                            They want natural & organic answers to pests & weeds <br>
                            They get enjoyment and satisfaction from growing their own food <br>
                            </p>
                        <h4 id="list-item-3">Ideate</h4>
                        <p> <strong>Empathy Map</strong> <br>
                            After we combined our interview data on the affinity diagram, we grouped similar cards and determined the concerns, frustrations, needs & goals of our user base. Our user has a long list of things they need to know when planting their gardens (sunlight, water, soil requirements, pest & weed management, etc) and that it takes multiple sources to find everything they need. <br>
                            Many of their plants have died in the past because of time management issues, or simply forgetting to tend to them. <br>
                            The gains for this user are the satisfaction from growing their own food, as well as reaping health benefits from their organic garden. <br>
                            
                            User Flow and Storyboard <br>
                            After defining our user and pinpointing pains and gains, we brainstormed features using ‘I Like, I Wish, What If’. We all marked our favorites and created a priority feature matrix. Our key features are developing an app that provides simple, succinct information, plant cards with all the information you need for growing, a calendar notification/reminder system, and natural pest and weed control.
                            
                            Then we created a user journey map to reveal opportunities for improvement at each step throughout the user’s interaction with the app. We found having a smooth & informative onboarding, vetted information, & instilling knowledgeable confidence key to making GreenThumb meet the user’s expectations & vastly improve their scenario. <br>
                            
                            Our storyboard demonstrates how GreenThumb helps our user, Emily, find all the information she needs to grow a successful garden for making salads at home. She ends feeling proud & satisfied with her harvest having found the information she needed with the GreenThumb app. <br>
                            
                            
                            Next we all created user flows for how a user might search for and add a plant to their virtual garden in the app. We combined & iterated on a flow that allowed our user to be onboarded with knowledge of what the app does, as well as permission screens for our location and notification functions. The flow then moves to searching for a plant, viewing a plant info card, selecting reminders, and adding the plant to the user’s garden.

                        <h4 id="list-item-4">Prototype</h4>
                        <p><strong>Sketches and Wireframes</strong>
                            We each created sketches of the user flow for initial user testing. Here we were able to compare and contrast what features were best at solving the problem statement. After completing user tests on our own sketch frames, we made notes of what we could change and combine into collaborative wireframes.
                            Changes were made to the home search screen, as well as the plant info card screens. More user tests were conducted to ensure our changes were beneficial for the user.
                            </p>
                        <h4 id="list-item-5">Test</h4>
                        <p>Direct Quotes:

                            “Oh, I can’t see that that says add” <br>
                            “When you have the allow the location data and stuff I’m more accustomed to it just popping up . . . and not having to click on something.” <br>
                            
                            After the sketches were tested, changes were made to lots of small features some specific ones were the home search screen, as well as the plant info card screens.
More user tests were conducted on the high fidelity prototype to ensure the iterations were both intuitive and beneficial for the user.
